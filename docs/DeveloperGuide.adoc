By: `Team W13-1 and Team SE-EDU`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
// tag::componentinteraction[]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `add-appt pid/1 did/7 d/2019-06-01 t/09:00`.

.Component interactions for `add-appt pid/1 did/7 d/2019-06-01 t/09:00` command
image::LogicComponentSequenceDiagram-AddAppointment.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// end::componentinteraction[]

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram_edited.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
// tag::logiccomponent[]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `DocXParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a new appointment).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions,
such as displaying help to the user or showing a different panel (appointment panel).

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("add-appt pid/1 did/7 d/2019-06-01 t/09:00")` API call. Interactions with other components such as
UI or Model is omitted or simplified for clarity.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add-appt ...` Command
image::AddAppointmentSequenceDiagramForLogic.png[width="800"]

// end::logiccomponent[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

Due to space constraint and to aid visibility, we will only include patient and doctor to illustrate our model.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramForPatientAndDoctor.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the DocX data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` and `ObeservableList<Doctor>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the DocX data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Patient Management Features

Patient is one of the two valid types of Person to be stored in the docX record.
The following features are implemented for patients of docX:

* Add patient
* Edit existing patient
* Delete patient
* List all patients
* Various search functions for patient
* Select patient

==== Add Patient feature
When a user executes 'add-p n/John Doe g/Male a/21 p/98765432 adr/Utown College 2'

Steps: +

. `LogicManager` calls parseCommand("add-p") in `DocXParser`.

. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, `DocXParser` builds a new `AddPatientCommandParser` and call function parse(arguments) of `AddPatientCommandParser`.

. `AddPatientCommandParser` parses the argument and get patient's name, gender, age, phone, address and an optional tag. `AddPatientCommandParser` calls constructors of Age, Gender, Phone, Address and Tag and then calls the constructor of `Patient`.

. `Patient` constructor will invoke the constructor of the parent `Person` class, which will call `PersonIdCounter` to generate a new unique Pid for this patient.

. A new `Patient` object is thus created with the specified fields with a `pid` and default appointment status of `COMPLETED`.

. Then, `AddPatientCommandParser` calls AddPatientCommand(Patient).

. LogicManager calls execute() of `AddPatientCommand`.

. The execute() calls hasPatient() of `Model`. If patient does not exist in the current DocX, the `Model` will call addPatient() and the patient will be successfully added.

.Simplified sequence diagram showing logic and model interaction when patient is successfully added
image::AddPatientSdForLogic.png[width="700"]

==== Edit Patient feature

When a user executes edit-p 1 n/Betty Sim

Steps: +

. `LogicManager` calls parseCommand("edit-p") in `DocXParser`.

. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, `DocXParser` builds a new `EditPatientCommandParser` and calls function parse(arguments) of `EditPatientCommandParser`.

. `EditPatientCommandParser` parses the argument and get the relative index of the patient to be edited
 and the respective field(s) to be changed. It will call `EditPatientDescriptor` and change the field(s) accordingly.

. `LogicManager` calls execute() of `EditPatientCommand`.

. execute() calls `getFilteredPatientList()` of `ModelManager` and then get the patient to be edited based on the specified index.

. A new editedPatient `Patient` object will be created based on the EditPatientDescriptor.

. Then, the execute() command continues to check if the patientToEdit and the editedPatient are the same, and if `model` contains the editedPatient.

. If both of the conditions are false, the `model` will set the editedPatient to replace the patientToEdit and the patient will be successfully edited.

==== Delete Patient feature

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete")` API call.

When a user executes `delete-p 1`

Steps: +

. LogicManager calls parseCommand("delete-p") in `DocXParser`.

. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, `DocXParser` builds a new DeletePatientCommandParser() and call function parse("1") of DeletePatientCommandParser.

. DeletePatientCommandParser parses the argument and get the relative list index of the patient to be deleted.
        Then, DeletePatientCommandParser calls DeletePatientCommand(index).

. LogicManager calls execute() of DeletePatientCommand.

. execute() calls getFilteredPatientList() of `ModelManager` and gets the patient to be deleted.
DeletePatientCommand calls deletePatient(patientToDelete) of `ModelManager`.

. `ModelManager` later commitDocX and the patient is successfully deleted.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-p` Command
image::DeletePatientSdForLogic.png[width="700"]

==== List Patient feature
When a user executes 'list-p', the full patient list will be displayed.

. `LogicManager` calls execute() of `ListPatientCommand`.

. execute() will call `Model` to `updateFilteredPatientList` by setting the predicate to show all the patients in the DocX currently.

==== Search Patient feature
There are various search commands available for patients. The internal workings of the search commands are similar and can be described together under this section.
Search commands: `search-p-name, search-pid, search-p-status, search-p-advanced`.

When a user executes `search-p-status ACTIVE`

Steps: +

. LogicManager calls parseCommand("search-p-status") in `DocXParser`.

. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, `DocXParser` builds a new `SearchPatientApptStatusCommandParser` and calls function parse("ACTIVE") of `SearchPatientApptStatusCommandParser`.

. `SearchPatientApptStatusCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if the entered argument is one of the four enum values: `ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, MISSED`.

. If the entered argument is valid, the command proceeds to execute. Otherwise, it will throw a ParseException and display the correct command usage to the user.

.Activity Diagram showing search-p-status
image::activitydiagramforsearchpatientstatus.png[width="800"]

==== Select Patient feature
When a user executes 'select-p [INDEX]', the full patient info will be displayed on the browser panel.

Steps: +

. LogicManager calls parseCommand("select-p") in `DocXParser`.

. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, `DocXParser` builds a new SelectPatientCommandParser() and calls function parse("1") of SelectPatientCommandParser.

. SelectPatientCommandParser parses the argument and get the relative list index of the patient to be selected.
     Then SelectPatientCommandParser calls SelectPatientCommand(index).

. LogicManager calls execute() of SelectPatientCommand.

. execute() calls getFilteredPatientList() of ModelManager and gets the patient to be selected.
SelectPatientCommand calls setSelectedPatient(selectedPatient) and then return a new `CommandResult` that will trigger browser panel display.

==== Appointment Status Display feature
The patient card will show the appointment status of a patient. It will display any one of the four enum values: `ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, MISSED`.
When an appointment is added, or marked, the execution of the command will cascade and alter the status display of the patient.
It follows the following rules:
. If the patient still has any other active appointments, a patient status will show `ACTIVE`
. Else, a patient status will reflect the latest status change to any of his appointment.

// tag::doctorcommands[]
=== CRUD of Doctors

Doctor is one of the two valid types of Persons to be stored in the docX record.
The following features are implemented or will be implemented for doctors of docX:

* Add doctor `add-d`
* List all doctors and search for doctors by keywords `list-d`
* Edit existing doctors `edit-d`
* Select a doctor to display the full details `select-d`
* Delete existing doctors `delete-d`
* Finding relevant and available doctors for upcoming appointments `match-d`

When a user executes `list-doctor acupu`

Step1. LogicManager calls parseCommand("list-d") in docXParser.

Step2. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, docXParser builds a new ListDoctorCommandParser() and calls function parse(arguments) of ListDoctorCommandParser.

Step3. ListDoctorCommandParser parses the argument. If no argument is present, then ListDoctorCommandParser calls ListDoctorCommand(). If there are argument(s) present, DoctorContainsKeywordsPredicate("acupu") will be created.
        Then, ListDoctorCommandParser calls ListDoctorCommand(DoctorContainsKeywordsPredicate).

Step4. LogicManager calls execute() of ListDoctorCommand.

Step5. execute() checks if the DoctorContainsPredicate equals to null. If it equals to null, it calls updateFilteredDoctorList() of Model to show all doctors.
        If it is not null, it calls updateFilteredDoctorList() of ModelManager.

Step6. test(Doctor) of DoctorContainsKeywordsPredicate will be called. It will check if any of the field matches "acupu" in full or part. If it matches, the doctor will be shown.


==== Edit Doctor feature

When a user executes `edit-d 1 n/Betty Veronica`

Step1. LogicManager calls parseCommand("edit-d") in docXParser.

Step2. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, docXParser builds a new EditDoctorCommandParser() and calls function parse(arguments) of EditDoctorCommandParser.

Step3. EditDoctorCommandParser parses the argument and get the relative index of the doctor to be changed and the respective field(s) to be changed.

// end::doctorcommands[]

=== Medical History Management Features

==== Current Implementation
`Medical History` is one of the core aspects of the application. It is used to track patients' medical records of seeing doctors.
`Medical History` and it's management features enable the build of relationships between `Patient` and `Doctor`.

The following features are implemented in current version of docX. The main classes and methods in *Logic* and *Model* components used to implement these features are shown below:

* Add medical history command: enabled by `MedicalHistory`, `AddMedHistCommand`, `AddMedHistCommandParser`, `Model#addMedHist`
* List medical history command: enabled by `ListMedHistCommand`, `ListMedHistCommandParser`, `Model#updateFilteredMedHistList`
* Sort medical history command: enabled by `ValidDate`, `SortMedHistCommand`, `SortMedHistCommandParser`, `Model#sortFilteredMedHistList`
* Edit medical history command: enabled by `EditMedHistCommand`, `EditMedHistCommandParser`, `Model#setMedHist`
* Search medical history command: enabled by `SearchMedHistCommand`, `SearchMedHistCommandParser`, `Model#updateFilteredMedHistList`
* Select medical history command: enabled by `SelectMedHistCommand`, `SelectMedHistCommandParser`, `Model#setSelectedMedHist`


==== Example Command: Sort Medical History Command
Sort medical history command enable users to sort medical history list by date of occurrence. This part will explain the workflow and implementation of sort medical history command in details.

Given below is the Activity Diagram for sort medical history command. It shows the workflow on a high level:

image::SortMedHistActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of sort medical history feature involving these classes: `MedicalHistory`, `ValidDate`, `SortMedHistCommand`, `SortMedHistCommandParser`

* `MedicalHistory` - This is an entity class used to store information regarding patients' medical histories of seeing doctors.
An Medical History object stores patient id, doctor id, corresponding patient, corresponding doctor, date, and writeup.

* `ValidDate` - This is an entity class used to represent a valid date of medical history. Using `java.time.LocalDate`,
this class ensures the date of a `Medical History` is today or a valid past date existing in the calender. This class also enable comparing two medical histories based on the date of occurrence.

* `SortMedHistCommandParser` - This is a class parsing a user's optional input string to an `SortMedHistCommand` object.
This class checks if the user's input string is valid ("", "ASC" or "DESC") before creating an object using input string.

* `SortMedHistCommand` - This is a class where the execution of sort medical history command happens.
It interacts with Model components to execute sorting of `UniqueMedHistList` object stored in `docX` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic and Model components for the "sort-med-hist ..." command:

image::SortMedHistSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Steps:

. When a user enters "sort-med-hist ..." in command box, execute() function of `LogicManager` is called by Ui component.
Then, parseCommand() function of `docXparser` matches the input string with a command type. Here, the command type is sort medical history.

. Based on the command type, corresponding command parser `SortMedHistCommandParser` is created. Function inside is then called to parse the argument string after command word "sort-med-hist".
Here, `SortMedHistCommandParser` checks the argument string is either "" or "ASC" or "DESC". If valid, the argument string will be used to construct `SortMedHistCommand`.

. The `LogicManager` then calls the execution of `SortMedHistCommand`, which interacts with Model component. In Model component, the internal list of medical histories in `UniqueMedHistList` is sorted.
Through a `ListChangeListener`, Ui component is updated the changes of medical history list order. Then the sorted list of medical histories will be displayed in user interface.

// tag::appointment[]

=== Add Appointment Feature
Appointments are created to facilitate future appointments between patients and doctors.
A patient can have none or multiple appointments, a doctor can have none or multiple appointments.
An appointment cannot overlap with a patient's or doctor's existing appointments.
This is determined if the date and time overlaps.
An appointment must specify a patient ID, doctor ID, date and time.

The following class diagram shows the modelling of appointments in our application. Details in Patient and Doctor are
omitted for clarity.

image::AppointmentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Current Implementation
The add appointment feature is enabled by the classes: `Appointment`, `FutureAppointment`,
`AddAppointmentCommandParser`, `AddAppointmentCommand` and `JsonAdaptedAppointment`.

* `Appointment` - This is an entity class to store information regarding an appointment, such as patient ID,
Doctor ID, date, time and status.

* `FutureAppointment` - This is an entity class that extends `Appointment`. This class ensures that a newly
created appointment is always in the future compared to the system time. The comparison between date and time is done using `java.time.LocalDateTime`. It is not recommended to perform such checks manually, as there are many edge case in a calendar.

* `AddAppointmentCommandParser` - This is a class that parses a user input string to an `AppointmentCommand` object.
Validation for user input data that do not require access to the model is performed here.

* `AddAppointmentCommand` - This is where the actual logic of the add appointment command is mainly performed.
It will access the model to ensure there is no duplicate appointment before adding the appointment to the model.

* `JsonAdaptedAppointment` - This class functions as an adapter between `Appointment` and the Storage layer.
It specifies how to convert from Java appointment object to JSON file format and vice versa.
This is also where validation for correct data format is performed when the save file is loaded back into memory.

The following sequence diagram shows how add appointment works on a high level:

image::AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


Steps:

. When a user enters an add appointment command, the input is first validated by `AddAppointmentCommandParser`.
Here, inputs that do not require access to the model is validated, such as ensuring patient ID, doctor ID, date and time are of the correct format, as well as ensuring the appointment is in the future.
A new `AddAppointmentCommand` object is created.

. The Logic layer then executes the `AddAppointmentCommand`. Here, the appointment is checked against existing appointments in the model to ensure there are no duplicates.
The appointment object is then sent to the Model layer.

. The model adds the appointment to its internal list. The internal list is a `javafx.collections.ObservableList` and the UI layer through a `ListChangeListener` is notified and updated following the observer pattern.

. The Logic layer will be notified that the model has been modified through an `InvalidationListener` and then it stores the new appointment to disk using the Storage layer.
The Storage layer will convert the appointment Java object into the JSON file format using the format specified in `JsonAdaptedAppointment`.
The next time the application is opened, the Storage layer will use `JsonAdaptedAppointment` again to convert appointments in the JSON file back into appointment objects.

// end::appointment[]

=== Prescriptions
Prescriptions are used to keep track of what kind of medicine a doctor suggest a particular patient to take. they
are useful because sometimes patients may want to know what medicine they took before. There are three functionalities
related to prescriptions, which are add a new prescription, edit an existing prescription and delete an existing
prescription respectively.



==== Add a New Prescription
Current proposed implementation

A user specifies the id of the patient, the id of the doctor, the date, the name of the medicine and a description of the prescription in command line. And
then the command processing procedure is roughly as follows:

Step1. LogicManager calls parseCommand("add-prescription") in DocXParser.

Step2. Based on the COMMAND_WORD, DocXParser builds a new AddPrescriptionCommandParser()
and call function parse(arguments) of AddPrescriptionCommandParser;

Step3. AddPrescriptionCommandParser parses patient id, doctor id, date, medicine name as well as the description of the prescription.

Step4. Constructors for patientId, doctorId, validDate, medicine and description are invoked. After this the constructor for Prescription is called to create a new prescription. Then AddPrescriptionCommandParser calls AddPrescriptionCommand(prescription).

Step5. LogicManager calls execute() of AddPrescriptionCommand.

Step6. execute() calls hasPrescription() of Model. If the prescription does not exist, call addPrescription() of Model.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

The data encryption feature will be implemented using the built-in JDK API javax.crypto.Cipher, without the need of
adding any external libraries or dependencies. We will look into whether to stick to the JSON file format or
something else.

// end::dataencryption[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAddressBookStorage.java[`JsonAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

==== Full Solution

See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/599[PR] for the step-by-step solution.
