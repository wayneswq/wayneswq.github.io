== Introduction

DocX is a desktop clinic management application designed for receptionists in small clinics.
Even today, many receptionists in small clinics are still using pen and paper to track patients' information, which can be prone to human errors and reduced productivity if the number of patients is large. Our clinic management application is designed specifically to make this process much easier for them.

The features we provide include:

* Record and manage patients coming to the clinic

* Record and manage doctors in the clinic

* Record and manage medical histories of patients

* Make and manage appointments for patients

* Record and manage medicines in the clinic and prescriptions given by doctors

While it has a GUI,
most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
More importantly, DocX is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
No technical knowledge on programming or terminal commands is needed.
If you can type normal words fast, DocX can get your clinic management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

.  Note that for now, docX only supports Command Line Interface (CLI). Clicking on any list is not allowed and will cause unexpected errors.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add-p`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 a/22 g/M adr/Utown College` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to docX.
* *`list-med-hist`* : lists all medical histories
* **`add-med-hist`**`pid/2 did/8 d/2018-12-09 sw/The patient had a cough. I told him to have a good rest` : adds a medical history of patient with specified id(pid) and doctor with specified id(did).
* *`exit`* : exits the app
